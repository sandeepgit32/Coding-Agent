# Fibonacci Series Generator

A lightweight and robust Python module to generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms. Includes comprehensive input validation, clear exception handling, and complete test coverage using pytest.

---

## Features

- Generate the Fibonacci series to any specified positive integer length.
- Clean API with comprehensive argument and error documentation.
- Modular code design for ease of maintenance and testing.
- Extensive unit and edge-case test coverage using `pytest`.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- (For testing) [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. *(Optional for testing:)* Install the testing dependency as shown in [Dependencies](#dependencies).
3. No other installation required; the main module uses only Python's standard library.

---

## Usage

You can use the Fibonacci series generator either as a script or as an importable function.

### Example: Using as Script

Run the Fibonacci module directly to print the series for a default term count (`n = 10`):

```sh
python fibonacci_series.py
```

**Output:**
```
Fibonacci series with 10 terms: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

### Example: Import and Use in Your Code

```python
from fibonacci_series import generate_fibonacci_series

# Generate the first 7 Fibonacci numbers
series = generate_fibonacci_series(7)
print(series)  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

---

## API Reference

### `generate_fibonacci_series(n_terms)`

Generate the Fibonacci series up to `n_terms` elements.

**Parameters:**
- `n_terms` (*int*): The number of terms to generate. Must be a positive integer.

**Returns:**
- `list`: The Fibonacci series as a list of integers.

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If `n_terms` is not a positive integer.

**Example:**
```python
generate_fibonacci_series(5)
# Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

---

## Testing

Tests are provided using `pytest` and cover:
- Typical valid usages
- Edge cases (single term, large term count)
- Error handling (zero, negative, non-integer, float)

### To Run All Tests:

1. Install all dependencies as listed in [Dependencies](#dependencies).
2. From your project root, run:

```sh
pytest
```

All tests should pass without error.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError:**  
  Ensure you are in the correct directory or your `PYTHONPATH` includes your project root.
- **ValueError:**  
  Always pass a *positive integer* for `n_terms`. Floating point or non-integer values (e.g., `"five"`, `5.5`) will raise a clear, descriptive error.
- **pytest not found:**  
  Install testing requirements with:
  ```
  pip install pytest==8.2.2
  ```

---

## Dependencies

All code (runtime) uses only the Python standard library. **Testing** uses `pytest`.

```text
pytest==8.2.2
```
