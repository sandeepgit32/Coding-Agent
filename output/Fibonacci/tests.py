# --- Test Execution Results ---
# All 9 tests passed successfully.

# --- Code Quality, Security, and Performance Assessment ---
# 1. Code Quality: The function is clean, PEP8-compliant, and has clear docstrings. Type and value checks are in place.
# 2. Security: No user input is executed in the logic; all input validation is proper. No risks detected.
# 3. Performance: The implementation is optimal for small to moderate n_terms; it uses consistent O(n) time/space.
# 4. Edge Handling: All edge and negative cases raise clear, specific exceptions.
# 5. Maintainability: The code is modular, easy to extend, and externally testable.
# 6. No code duplication, and no global state is mutated.
# No changes are required for quality, security, or performance.
